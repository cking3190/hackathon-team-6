# Overview

The application provides a User Interface that provides advanced searching capabilities such as auto-completion 
and boosting search results based on specific criteria.

# Overview

In a live production environment we are able to update underlying search conditions to meet customer needs without involving any other teams.  

# Justification

The group decided to construct an application that would demonstrate not only the value of an integrated search engine
with a database but, most importantly, without the expense of an ETL process while indicating how quickly 
search priority could be modified with changing market conditions.  

Inspiration was from the ease of use and the
power of making real-time changes to critical search functionality in minimum time without an expensive development
sprint from a software engineering team.  From a Presales perspective, this demonstration will show the customer
exactly what happens and what effort is required when a customer determines they need to change search priority.

This illustrates developer productivity, resiliency, scalability, and ease of use among a variety of integration points 
with MongoDB's Application Development Platform.
